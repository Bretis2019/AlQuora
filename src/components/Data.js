            "There was a real danger that would happen — which is why Michael absolutely had to leave the country and leave it IMMEDIATELY. There were a number of factors, however, working in his favor:\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Because Michael had absolutely no police record or had ever been arrested, he couldn’t be identified from police photos.\n" +
                    "By being out of the country, he couldn’t be identified in a police line-up.\n" +
                    "As Clemenza pointed out, as long as Michael dropped the gun and walked out of there quickly, the “other patrons would be too scared and shocked to get a good look at his face.” That might have been the single biggest factor working for him, by the way. But it only worked if he left the restaurant immediately.\n" +
                    "Any picture of Michael in the newspapers would likely show him in his Marine Corps uniform, wearing a medal, looking like a “hero.” And that would help him look like he couldn’t have committed a crime."

        answers: [
            "The novel wrote about Vito yelling at Sonny as a teenager. Clemenza had to report that Sonny and some of his friends committed a robbery. Vito was furious that Sonny risked his neck for a few dollars-he yelled what did you get out of it $20, $50? Sonny countered that he knew what Viyo did for a living, telling him that he saw Vito shoot Fanucci (Sonny saw his father follow Fanucci and followed and saw the shooting. It’s not in the movie). Vito stopped yelling at Sonny. Sonny quickly said that he could sell olive oil in the family business. Vito asked “Wouldn’t you rather go to college? A lawyer with a briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns?” Sonny didn’t want to go back to school. Vito realized that every man has his destiny and told Sonny to report to Clemenza in the morning. Clemenza trained Sonny to be Vito’s bodyguard first until Vito was shot (this is the war Clemenza referred to in GF with Michael and not the Sollozzo shooting) and Sonny grabbed some men to take care of business. It was clear Sonny learned the business.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "As for Fredo, he wasn’t very keen on education but didn’t do what Sonny did. Fredo drifted into the business because he didn’t know what else to do. There wasn’t much to talk to with Fredo."
            , "Yes with Sonny. When Sonny got busted for an attempted armed robbery Vito lost his temper and read Sonny the riot act in Sicilian, a language which Vito found more useful for rage. When Sonny countered that he had seen his father commit murder, Vito lost his anger. He tried to convince Sonny to go to college and become a lawyer but Sonny wanted in the business. Vito assented but started giving life lesson and leadership speeches for Sonny’s benefit when Sonny was around.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "We don’t know about Fredo, but probably. There’s a line that says something like Fredo insisted on joining the business after high school.\n" +

                    "With Michael the narration at the wedding tells us that Michael was the only child who had refused the great man’s [Vito’s] direction and was sitting as far away as he could to proclaim his chosen alienation from father and family.\n" +

When Michael doesn’t say anything Vito gets irritated and says it won’t be anything that Michael doesn’t approve of or that will stop Michael from going his own way."

            "Well, they do show Tony talking to bosses, capos and underbosses from the Commission, but something that probably gets missed by most viewers is that the DiMeo Crew in New Jersey is not… one of the named Five Families of New York. I missed this for a long time, myself, but they weren’t really even considered a “family” by most of the underworld.\n" +

            "The Family of the New York Five that Tony Soprano answered to is the Lupertazzi Family, of whom the boss was Carmine Lupertazzi for most of the show.

            "When the Commission was first formed, it’s membership was relatively diverse and eclectic - the big 6 were clearly represented (NYC Five Families and the Chicago Outfit), as well as a small number of other respected bosses e.g. Stefano Maggadino from Buffalo.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "And whilst membership has ebbed and flowed, todays Commission (to the extent it still meets) is just the big six - all other families are represented by one of said six at the Commission table.\n" +

            "The Sopranos DiMeo family is a proxy/cut out of the real life DeCavalcante family.
